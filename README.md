# Python-Refresher
Let's first of all refreshing on basic data types we have:
1/String
2/List/Array
3/Tuple
4/Set
5/Dictionary

What are the key methods that the data types we have? What are the basic options?

When to use each?

Chapter 8
Definition: A class is a template or blueprint that defines how variables (attributes) and functions (methods) are named and used within its objects.

What are the benefits of using a class? (ERS)
| Benefit          | Why Itâ€™s Useful                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Encapsulation | Keeps related logic and data together         |
| 2. Reusability   | Allows shared behavior with less code         |
| 3. Statefulness  | Objects can store memory and evolve over time |

When to use a class and when to use a function?
Functions = great for stateless tools, scripts, transformations (data transformation/pipelines)
Classes = great for stateful models, reusable components, large systems (Game design, UI design)

Misc. Notes:

What are the different styles of naming a object?

| Style          | Example          | Usage                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| lowerCamelCase | myFunctionName   | Variables, functions in JavaScript, Java, TypeScript         |
| UpperCamelCase | MyClassName      | Class names, types, constructors                             |
| snake_case     | my_variable_name | Python variables and functions                               |
| kebab-case     | my-variable-name | URLs, CSS class names                                        |
